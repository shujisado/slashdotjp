<h2>
How do I submit stories to Slashdot?</h2>
You can submit a story by using the <a href="/submit.pl">Submissions Bin</a>.
When you submit a story, please remember to include appropriate links.
Also, you'll have a better chance of getting our attention if you use a
clear and specific subject line.
<p>Before you submit a story, <b>please</b> take a minute to make sure
it's not a duplicate of a story we've posted already. Check the <a href="/">main
Slashdot page</a> and make sure it hasn't already been posted. If it's
not breaking news, you might also run a <a href="/search.pl">search</a>
to see if it's something that might have been posted on a previous day.
Roughly ten percent of all our story submissions are duplicates of stories
we've already posted.

<H2>Where do I submit Press Releases?</H2>

Slashdot will certainly review press releases from anyone who chooses to
submit them through our <A href=/submit.pl>standard submission form</A>.
 However, please be aware that your product/service/tradeshow might not
be as interesting to us as it is to you, and we are relatively unlikely
to select press releases to be posted to the Slashdot main page.  You're
welcome to try, but please <A href=/submit.pl>use the form</A> as our
email boxes are already bursting at the seams with unwanted press
releases that if printed, could easily wallpaper a large portion of the
Pyramids at Giza.

<h2>
Can I submit a story anonymously?</h2>
Yes. And furthermore, anonymous submission will not increase or decrease
the chances that we'll select it. (We do, however, reserve the right to
refer to you as an Anonymous Coward, and mock you mercilessly.)

<h2>
How do I Ask Slashdot?</h2>
Ask Slashdot is maintained by <a href="mailto:cliff@slashdot.org">Cliff</a>.
We prefer that you submit questions through <a href="http://slashdot.org/submit.pl">the
submissions form</a>, selecting the section "Ask Slashdot" so we know to
route the question to Cliff.

<br><a NAME="ed200"></a>
<h2>
Why didn't you post my story?</h2>
This is a tough one.
<p>Slashdot gets hundreds of submissions every day. Every day our authors
go through these submissions, and try to select the most interesting, timely,
and relevant ones to post to the homepage. There are probably as many reasons
for stories to get rejected as there are stories, but here are some of
the more common ones:
<ul>
<li>
Badly worded subjects</li>

<li>
Broken or missing URLs</li>

<li>
Confusing or hysterical sounding writeup</li>

<li>
It might be an old story</li>

<li>
It might just be a busy day and we've already posted enough stories</li>

<li>
Someone already submitted your story</li>

<li>
Your story just might not be interesting!</li>
</ul>
This last one requires a little explanation: if you submit a story, and
we don't select it because we think it's not particularly interesting,
we're not making a judgment about you as a human being. Deciding the interest
level of a story is a very subjective thing, and we have to take into account
not only the intrinsic interest of the story itself, but what else is happening
that day. On a day when lots of things are happening, we reject some very
good stories. But on a day when nothing interesting is happening, we may
post something not really as cool.
<p>The <b>bottom line</b> is that we have to select stories with an eye
towards whatever is going to make Slashdot be what it is for that particular
day. (If you want a slightly fuller explanation of this idea, read about
<a href="editorial.shtml#ed900">The Omelette</a>.)

<h2>
Why hasn't my story been accepted or rejected yet?</h2>
Usually stories are examined within a few hours of their submission. Sometimes,
however (and usually with stories that are submitted as Ask Slashdot or
chosen as potential quickies), it might be weeks before it closes. Usually
these things aren't time dependent... the answer won't change if the question
is posed tomorrow or in a week, and since Ask Slashdot gets 5x more submissions
then we use, there's some delay there. So be patient. You can <a href="mailto:cliff@slashdot.org">mail
Cliff</a> if you have a specific question about an Ask Slashdot.

<h2>
Why do some stories show up in the index, but not on the homepage?</h2>
Slashdot has too many submissions to post them all, but many submissions
are worth posting for folks specifically interested in them. We post many
stories in the sub sections that don't appear on the homepage. Examples
are <a href="http://slashdot.org/askslashdot">Ask Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro">Your
Rights Online</a>, and <a href="http://slashdot.org/apache">Apache</a>.
Each of these sections has a smaller, more devoted group of readers with
a more specific interest in these subjects.
<p>These sections are listed on the left hand side of Slashdot, along with
the date they were last updated, and the number of stories that appeared
within that section on that day.

<h2>
My story submission was "accepted"; how come I never saw it?</h2>
Usually it's because of <a href="editorial.shtml#ed230">this</a>, but sometimes
you just need to be patient. Many stories are accepted, but not posted
for a few hours (for a variety of reasons: to give existing stories some
time to be read and commented on, or to have a second author give a second
opinion on some detail).

<h2>
Sometimes I see duplicate stories on Slashdot. What's up with that?</h2>
These are just mistakes on the part of the staff. They happen. We have
posted over ten thousand stories in our history. The occasional duplicate
is inevitable.
<p>If you see a duplicate, you can mail the story's author. If the story
is still quiet, we may pull it down. However, once the comments are rolling
in, we often leave the story up so that the discussion can continue.
<p>Some people have suggested that there might be a software solution to
this problem. If you think you've got one, visit <a href="http://slashcode.com">the
Slashcode site</a> and submit a diff. As long as it isn't a performance
hit, I'd consider using it. (Be aware however that the trick of searching
for duplicate URLs isn't as helpful as you might think, since the same
story can appear in multiple locations.)

<h2>
I submitted that a month ago!</h2>
A lot of times, we don't use a particular story on a particular day, but
at some later point, someone else submits it, and it ends up getting used.
We have 4 to 6 guys working together to post things on Slashdot. What one
of us finds stupid, the others might find interesting. Or it just might
be the rest of the stuff that's going on that day. There are a variety
of factors: the personality of the post, the quality of the submission,
or even the quantity of stories already posted when your submission entered
the queue.

<h2>
Someone else got credit for a story I submitted!</h2>
As a whole we think we do a good job, but sometimes we make mistakes. We're
always sorry when we do, but considering the thousands of weekly submissions,
we think we're definitely coming out ahead.

<h2>
I want to write an editorial. What should I do?</h2>
Before you get carried away, <a href="mailto:malda@slashdot.org">mail me</a>
a synopsis of your idea (put the text 'Proposed Feature' in the subject).
That way I can tell you if it is something we would consider posting before
you bother to write the whole thing.
<p>And, hey - even if we're not interested in it, there's always a chance
someone else will be. If we say "no thanks," you might want to query some
of the other websites before you drop the idea.

<h2>
I want to write a book review. What should I do?</h2>
Make sure the book hasn't been reviewed before, or at least anytime lately.
Also, be sure to read our <a href="http://slashdot.org/book.review.guidelines.shtml">book
review guidelines</a> so you know what we're looking for. When you're ready
to submit it, you can do so on our <a href="http://slashdot.org/submit.pl">submissions
page</a>. When submitting your book review, you can help us out by marking
it for the "Book Reviews" section, so that it gets sorted into the proper
channels. (and increases the chances of it getting posted) Any questions
about the process? You can email <a href="mailto:timothy@slashdot.org">timothy</a>
with them, and he'll help you out.

<h2>
Why is your grammar/spelling so bad?</h2>
We're more interested in getting the stories out quickly than we are in
making sure every post passes the white glove test. These days we have
a copy editor who catches most of the spelling and grammar mistakes, but
things do sometimes slip through.
<p>If you see a mistake in a story, email the author. We'll get it fixed
pronto.

<h2>
Why did you post story X?</h2>
Slashdot is many things to many people. Some people think it's a Linux
site. To others, it's a geek hangout. I've always worked very hard to make
sure that Slashdot matches up with my interests and the interests of my
authors. We think we're pretty typical Slashdot readers... but that does
mean that occasionally one of us might post something that you think is
inappropriate. You might be interested in my <a href="editorial.shtml#ed900">Omelette
rant</a>.
<p>Personally, I have a pet peeve when people post comments saying things
like "That's not News For Nerds!" and "That's not Stuff that Matters!"
Slashdot has been running for almost 5 years, and over that time, I have
always been the final decision maker on what ends up on the homepage. It
turns out that a lot of people agree with me: Linux, Legos, Penguins, Sci
(both real and fiction). If you've been reading Slashdot, you know what
the subjects commonly are, but we might deviate occasionally. It's just
more fun that way. Variety Is The Spice Of Life and all that, right? We've
been running Slashdot for a long time, and if we occasionally want to post
something that someone doesn't think is right for Slashdot, well, we're
the ones who get to make the call. It's the mix of stories that makes Slashdot
the fun place that it is.

<h2>
How do you verify the accuracy of Slashdot stories?</h2>
We don't. You do. :) If something seems outrageous, we might look for some
corroboration, but as a rule, we regard this as the responsibility of the
submitter and the audience. This is why it's important to read comments.
You might find something that refutes, or supports, the story in the main.

<h2>
Slashdot seems to be very U.S.-centric. Do you have any plans to be more
international in your scope?</h2>
Slashdot <i>is</i> U.S.-centric. We readily admit this, and really don't
see it as a problem. Slashdot is run by Americans, after all, and the <i>vast</i>
majority of our readership is in the U.S. We're certainly not opposed to
doing more international stories, but we don't have any formal plans for
making that happen. All we can really tell you is that if you're outside
the U.S. and you have news,&nbsp;<link>submit it, and if it looks interesting,
we'll post it.

<h2>
Would you be interested in creating mirror sites in other languages and
have people translate articles? Different articles for different sites?</h2>
There are some sites like this already. For example, there's a <a href="http://www.barrapunto.com">Spanish
site</a>, and a Portuguese one. These sites aren't run by us, however.
We have discussed the possibility of international mirrors, but we haven't
made any decisions yet.

<h2>
"The Omelette"</h2>
Let me try to give you an analogy for Slashdot's homepage. It's like an
omelette: it's a combination of sausage and ham and tomatoes and eggs and
more. Over the years, we've figured out what ingredients are best on Slashdot.
The ultimate goal is, of course, to create an omelette that I enjoy eating:
by 8pm, I want to see a dozen interesting stories on Slashdot. I hope you
enjoy them too. I believe that we've grown in size because we share a lot
of common interests with our readers. But that doesn't mean that I'm gonna
mix an omelette with all sausages, or someday throw away the tomatoes because
the green peppers are really fresh.
<p>There are many components to the Slashdot Omelette. Stories about Linux.
Tech stories. Science. Legos. Book Reviews. Yes, even Jon Katz. By mixing
and matching these things each and every day, we bring you what I call
Slashdot. On some days it definitely is better than others, but overall
we think it's a tasty little treat and we hope you enjoy eating as much
as we enjoy cooking it.

<H2>What are the Slashdot Sections for?</H2>

Stories on Slashdot can appear on the main page (the one you see when you
go to <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot.org</a>, or in the site's
various subsections such as Science and Ask Slashdot. If you're wondering
what each of those section names really means, we hope this page will
clear things up.  Some sections have specific editors associated with them.
Feel free to directly contact those editors with specific questions about
the section.

<H3>Articles</H3>
This is Slashdot's catch-all category. If your submission
doesn't fit better into one of the sections described below, you can
always choose "Articles."  Of course, if you choose an appropriate
section, your submission will be more quickly put in the hands of the
right person.


<H3>Apache</H3> The Apache section is for anything about the <a
href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> web server.

<H3>Apple</H3>
For all things Mac, or otherwise related to Apple computers and OS X.
<P><B>Editor</B> <A href=mailto:pudge@slashdot.org>pudge@slashdot.org</A>


<H3>Ask Slashdot</H3>
If you're seeking advice from the Slashdot readership about
jobs, computer hardware, software glitches, philosophical problems, etc,
select the Ask Slashdot section.

<P>If you're seeking advice from the Slashdot readership about jobs,
computer hardware, software glitches, philosophical problems, etc,
select the Ask Slashdot section.  Regarding Legal Advice: When seeking
advice on topics that touch on legal aspects, please remember that you
should always be prepared to consult professional legal representation.
It doesn't hurt to Ask Slashdot for pointers, and suggestions to save
you some time, but Ask Slashdot should not be used in place of
professional legal representation.

<P><B>Editor</B> <A href=mailto:cliff@slashdot.org>cliff@slashdot.org</A>

<h3>Book Reviews</H3>
This section is for your original book reviews on (not
necessarily) tech books, the more recent the better.  If you're interested
in submitting book reviews to slashdot, make sure you've read through the
<a href="https://slashdot.org/book.review.guidelines.shtml">book review
guidelines</a>, too.
<P><B>Editor</B> <A href=mailto:timothy@slashdot.org>timothy@slashdot.org</A>


<H3>BSD</H3>
The BSD section hosts news about the various modern UNIXes derived
from Berkeley's distribution (like Free, Open and NetBSD).

<H3>Developers</H3>
News about the software, or anything that directly
affects the practice of programming. A new programming language? A useful
technique? Licensing snafus? Use "Developers."

<h3>Features</H3> For your original feature-length articles.

<H3>Games</H3>
If it beeps, scores points, and robs you from time at work, odds
are good you should be choosing Games.
<P>Editors <A href=mailto:games@slashdot.org>games@slashdot.org</A>

<H3>Geeks in Space</H3>
Don't select this topic! Geeks in Space is an occasional
web audio broadcast featuring several of the editors of Slashdot.
If you select this as your section, it will almost certainly be
laughed at and deleted unread.

<H3>Interviews</H3> This is a good place to suggest possible Slashdot interviewees
(with contact information, if possible, and background material for
un-informed editors).
<P>Editor <A href=mailto:roblimo@slashdot.org>roblimo@slashdot.org</A>

<H3>Polls</H3> 
Submit your most thought-provoking poll questions here. Suggestion:
provide 4-6 potential answers of no more than 12 words each, and phrase
your poll answers in the form of a list.

<H3>Science</H3> This is the place for science articles. Cool technology, space
telescope observations, interesting medical research ... all perfect for
the Science section.

<h3>Your Rights Online</H3> News affecting your ability to live as a free,
responsible person online belongs in the Your Rights Online (YRO) section.
Spam, invasions of privacy, onerous licenses -- they all go here.
