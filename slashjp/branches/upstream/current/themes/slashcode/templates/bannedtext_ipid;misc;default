<h1>Either your network or IP address has been banned from [% constants.sitename %]</h1><br>
Either your network or IP address has been banned from [% constants.sitename %],
due to script flooding, excessive robot crawling, or the posting of
comments designed to break web browser rendering, that originated from
your network or IP address.  If you feel that this is unwarranted,
feel free to include your IP address (<b>[% ip %]</b>) in the
subject of an email to
<a href="mailto:[% constants.adminmail_ban | strip_attribute %]">[% constants.adminmail_ban %]</a>,
and we will examine why there is a ban. If you fail to include the IP address (again,
<em>in the subject!</em>), then your message will be deleted and ignored. I mean
come on, we're good, we're not psychic.
