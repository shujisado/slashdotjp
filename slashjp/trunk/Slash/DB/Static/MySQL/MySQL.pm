# Quick overview:  This method takes a list of uids who are eligible
# to be moderators and returns that same list, with the "worst"
# users made statistically less likely to be on it, and the "best"
# users more likely to remain on the list and appear more than once.
# Longer explanation:
# This method takes a list of uids who are eligible to be moderators
# (i.e., eligible to receive tokens which may end up giving them mod
# points).  It also takes several numeric values, positive numbers
# that are almost certainly slightly greater than 1 (e.g. 1.3 or so).
# For each uid, several values are calculated:  the total number of
# times the user has been M2'd "fair," the ratio of fair-to-unfair M2s,
# and the ratio of spent-to-stirred modpoints.  Multiple lists of
# the uids are made, from "worst" to "best," the "worst" user in each
# case having the probability of being eligible for tokens (remaining
# on the list) reduced and the "best" with that probability increased
# (appearing two or more times on the list).
# The list of which factors to use and the numeric values of those
# factors is in $wtf_hr ("what to factor");  its currently-defined
