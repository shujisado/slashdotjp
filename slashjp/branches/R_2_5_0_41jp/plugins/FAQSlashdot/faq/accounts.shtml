<H2>Why should I log in?</H2> 

	<P>Logged in users have a variety of benefits on Slashdot that are unavailable
	to users who don't bother logging in.  Among these benefits are:
	
	<UL>
		<LI>The ability to save user preferences from visit to visit.
		<LI>Your own <A href=/journal.pl>Journal</A> in which to share your innermost feelings.
		<LI>The ability to define Friends & Foes to aid in reading discussions.
		<LI>A chance to participate in Slashdot's Moderation and Meta Moderation System.
		<LI>Posting in Discussions at Score:1 instead of Score:0 means twice as many people will see your comments.
	
	</UL>
	<P>So do it!  <A href=/users.pl>Log In</A> Already!

<H2>Can I change my nickname?</H2> 

	<P>You can't. Sorry. It's just too prone to abuse. You can't delete
	your own comments.  You can't change your name. There are no exceptions
	to this.

<H2>How can I delete my account?</H2> 

	<P>You can't. The system needs to keep track of the users, so accounts
	are permanent. Don't sweat leaving unused accounts hanging around. It
	doesn't hurt anything.

<H2>I forgot/can't get my password!</H2> 

	You should be able to get it from <A HREF="/users.pl">the user
	login page</A>.  Just type in your nickname and hit 'mailpasswd' and
	your password will be whisked off to your email address.  If, however, this
	doesn't seem to be working, email <A

<H2>I'm having trouble logging in.</H2> 

	<P>Make sure you have cookies turned on. If you don't, it won't work.
	Also make sure that the date and time on your computer is correct.
	In an handful of cases, the problem could be related to  a problem
	with a proxy server, but this is very unlikely. If you've turned
	cookies on and tried again to log in, and it still doesn't work, email
	<A HREF="mailto:passwords@slashdot.org">passwords@slashdot.org</A> for help.

	
<P>Really, though, the system works for thousands of people every day, so the 
  problem is most likely on your end ;) <BR>

<h2>I'm having trouble logging into Slashdot Sections (Like Apple, YRO, or BSD)</h2>
<p>You can be logged into slashdot while you view any of the subsections. All 
  you need to do is hit any of the sections, and log in. Logging into one of them 
  logs you into all. But you need to log into at least one section <i>seperate</i> 
  from logging into <a href="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</a>. 
<p>Yeah, we know this is confusing, but we didn't write the RFC for cookies. Sorry 
  for the inconvenience.<br>

<H2>I don't want to accept a cookie!</H2> 


	<P>A lot of people are paranoid about cookies, and not without reason,
	but the simple fact is that this is how you create persistence
	in a stateless protocol. I've heard all the arguments and all the 
	debates on the subject, and this is how we're doing it.
	
	<P>If you don't want to use cookies, you don't have to. You can still
	post (either anonymously, or by entering your password each time you
	submit a comment) but you will not be able to use all of the advanced
	features of Slashdot (story filtering, customized Slashboxes, user
	preferences etc.). If your paranoia requires you not to use cookies, 
	this is the sacrifice you'll have to make.

<H2>Someone is posting under a false identity, or an account designed to look like someone else</H2>

	<P>There are many accounts in the system that were created for
	malicious purposes. There are dozens of variations on names like
	'CmdrTaco' and 'Hemos' as well as heads of many corporations, writers,
	etc.  We don't tamper with existing accounts though, so there's nothing
	we   can do about it.  Over the last few years, numerous restrictions
	have been placed on accounts to make this difficult (for example the
	system won't let you create an account named 'CmdrTaco' because there
	already is one listed) but that doesn't prevent any of the hundreds
	of existing ninnies from doing what ninnies do.

	<P>In most cases, these folks are caught by <A
	HREF="com-mod.shtml#cm600">moderation</A>, and they eventually get <A
	HREF="com-mod.shtml#cm700">karma</A> that is low enough to make it
	obvious that they are impostors.

<H2>Why do I keep getting randomly logged out?</H2>

	
<P>You might need to log in to both 'foo.slashdot.org' and 'slashdot.org'. Because 
  of how cookies work, if you log into the latter first, you might find yourself 
  logged out of the former. Or vice versa. Once you log into both,
  you'll be fine. Yes, this is annoying. No we can't fix it. We don't write 
  the RFCs.<BR>

<H2>Do you ban people from Slashdot?</H2>

	
<P>Occassionally we <a href="accounts.shtml#ac900">ban IPs</a> who are abusing 
  our servers in some way. If this happens, please read 
  <a href="accounts.shtml#ac1000">How do I get an IP Unbanned</a>. 
  These bans are relatively rare, but they are necessary in cases where specific
  Users or IPs intentionally try to disrupt service for other users by crapflooding
  the forums, game the moderation system, or to overburden our servers.
  
<p> The moderation system has a variety of limits in it as well, but these bans 
  are temporary and exist more as a rate limiter to make sure that people stay 
  on topic, and everyone gets a chance to speak. You can learn more about the 
  moderation system by reading <a href="com-mod.shtml">Comments and Moderation</a>.

<h2>Why is my IP banned?</h2>
<p>&middot; Perhaps you are running some sort of program that loaded thousands of 
Slashdot Pages.  We have limited resources here and are fairly protective of 
them.  We need to make sure that everyone shares.  If your IP loads thousands 
of pages in a day, you will likely be banned.  Please note that many proxy 
servers load large quantities of pages, but we can usually distinguish 
between proxy servers being used by humans, and IPs running software that is 
hammering our servers.<p>
&middot; Your IP might have been used to perform some sort of denial of service 
attack against Slashdot.  These range from simple programs that just load a 
lot of pages, to programs that attempt to coordinate an avalanche of posts
in the forums (often through misconfigured "Open Relay" proxy servers).<p>
&middot; You might be using a proxy server that is also being used by another person 
  who did something from the above list. You should have your <b>proxy server 
  administrator</b> <a href="mailto:banned@slashdot.org">contact us</a>.<p>
&middot; Your IP might have been used to post comments designed to break 
web browser rendering. <br>

  <h2>How do I get an IP Unbanned?</h2>
  <p>Email <a href="mailto:banned@slashdot.org">banned@slashdot.org</a>. Make 
    sure to include the IP in question, UID, timeframes, and any other pertinent information. If 
    you are connecting through a proxy server, you might need to have your proxy 
    server's admin contact us instead of you.<br>

  <h2>My RSS Headline Reader Tells me I Was Banned!</h2>
  <P>Due largely to the absolutely ridiculous amount of abuse we get on
    a daily basis from poorly implemented headline readers, we were
    forced to implement a much more liberal automated banning system
    on RSS/RDF headline reading applications.  Our policy is to allow
    one request every 30 minutes.  We'll allow a few more before you
    will get banned, and we are more flexible still with proxy servers.
    However, in many cases, we have no choice but to ban abuse.

  <p>You should still be able to access the rest of the website, just not
    the <tt>.rss</tt>, <tt>.rdf</tt>, and <tt>.xml</tt> pages.

  <p>You have 2 options: First is to stop beating the crap out of our
    servers, and just wait a few days/hours.  Depending on the
    severity of the abuse, you should be back in a couple of days.
    If, after 72 hours, you are still banned, please Email <a
    href="mailto:banned@slashdot.org">banned@slashdot.org</a> and ask
    for help. Please include the approximate time of the ban, the MD5
    that the ban message told you to tell us, and what <em>you</em>
    think your IP number is.

  <P>If you have reason to believe you're connecting through a proxy
    server, please mention that too -- and you might need to have your
    proxy server's admin contact us instead of you.<br>

    <h2>Why is someone else's User Name appearing on my User Page's Menu?</h2>
    <p>This is not a bug.  This is a feature!  That name is the last user page
    (besides your own ;) that you have visited.  This is useful when you
    want to hop around between your user info, and someone else's: to
    compare friends and foes for example.  Your account has not been
    hacked, this is totally by design. <br>

    <H2>What are Login Sessions?</H2>
    <P> A login session is a glorified cookie.  To provide some added
    security, you can determine the location and time duration for
    your session.  The duration choices are 'Lasts Forever' and 'Closes
    With Browser' and should be pretty self-explanatory.  The former is
    good if you are the only person using your computer.  The latter is
    nice if you are slightly paranoid, or often log in from remote
    terminals.

    <P>The second decision is your location.  The first choice is
    'Never Moves' which basically means you have a static IP and you
    never log out of Slashdot or share your computer.  The second
    choice is 'Moves within Subnet' which is useful if you have a
    desktop and never log out, but your ISP likes to change your IP
    on you occasionally.  The last choice is 'Follows me Everywhere'
    which is the choice for machines that move from network
    to network.  This last option is the least secure, but oh-so
    convenient.  It is also the default.<BR>
