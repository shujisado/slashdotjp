Some more info to help Debian users.  Please read the main INSTALL first.

(Note, August 2003:  this file is pretty well out of date by now.
The main INSTALL file is becoming more useful for Debian sites.)

Author: Bernard de Rubinat <bernard@netgames.org>

The methods in INSTALL work fine for Debian, but many will prefer the
apt-get method.  For each package below, you can use:

    apt-get install PACKAGE

Some packages do not exist; install those using other methods.

NOTES:

* perl 5.6 should work fine too, in place of perl 5.005.
* Apache and mod_perl packages might not work.  If not, install from
  the source, as per the instructions in INSTALL.
* Some issues arose with the installation of the apache-perl
  package. If you ALREADY are using the "apache" package, and have
  a working system, then you should probably install the 
  "libapache-mod-perl" package as opposed to installing the
  "apache-perl" package, as the latter is just apache staticallly
  compiled with mod_perl. In most instances using the 
  "apache" package with "libapache-mod-perl" is sufficient.
