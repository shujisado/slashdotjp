<H2>How about an NNTP news gateway? </H2>

	
<P>I'd love to, but there are several problems that complic<a name="su100"></a>ate 
  this: first is the time to program it. An NNTP gateway is definitely on the 
  TO-DO list, but it's lower on the priority list then many other things. Second 
  is advertising: Slashdot costs a lot to run each month, and our performance 
  is measured in terms of dollars and pages. If we can figure out a way to put 
  advertising (and don't worry, it'd be reasonably minimal) into the NNTP comments 
  cleanly, we'd be all set. Finally, the moderation system really doesn't have 
  a counterpart in NNTP. 
<P>So you put it all together and you have something that would be
	pretty nifty, but it has several problems. It'll happen someday,
	but not tomorrow.

<H2>Have you considered rewriting Slashdot in C? </H2>

	<P>Since Slashdot is almost entirely database calls to MySQL and text
	parsing, Perl is the ideal language for it: the hefty work is handled
	by MySQL (which is already written in C++) and string processing is
	already Perl's forte.  I doubt that we would get a worthwhile enough
	performance boost by rewriting the code in C to make it worth the
	effort. mod_perl precompiles and caches the Perl scripts anyway, so
	the overhead is not really that bad.

<A NAME="su300"></a>
<H2>Have you considered PHP? </H2>

	<P>I tried PHP briefly but rejected it in favor of Perl.  This is in no
	way a criticism of PHP, I just knew Perl already and was quite in love
	with the language.  This <I>was</I> several years ago, and I understand
	PHP has grown and matured greatly since I made this decision, so my
	guess is that the limitations and awkwardness that made it undesirable
	to me back then is largely gone. But at this point, we have a
	substantial code base all written in Perl, and the effort involved in
	rewriting it would be prohibitive.  Besides, Perl is cool.

<A NAME="su400"></a>
<H2>How about a page for rejected or pending story submissions? </H2>

	<P>This is a frequently requested feature that has several variations
	that essentially have the same answer: Time and Abuse.

	<P><B>Time</B> is a resource that we always lack, so anything that we
	do that increases the amount of time required to maintain Slashdot has
	to be weighed carefully.  A good example is the existing submission
	monitoring functionality.  The amount of email I got regarding rejected
	submissions more then <I>doubled</I> when I added notification.  I'm
	afraid that a public forum for pending/rejected stories would simply
	complicate the life of our authors.

	<P><B>Abuse</B> is much worse.  We get hundreds of submissions a day:
	we don't need more submissions, we need better ones. A public forum
	that gets the kind of traffic we get tends to be abused (like, say, the
	Slashdot comments for example).  We don't want to be deleting "First
	Posts" and "Natalie Portman" type trolls and spams from the submission
	bin: we're busy enough as is.  
	
	<P><B>Appropriateness</B> From there, we move to the many stories that
	are submitted which are very wrong for Slashdot.  They are horribly off
	topic, or offensive, or just plain scary. Obituaries for people that
	aren't dead?  Rants about events that never occurred? Random Conspiracy
	Theories? Bug reports?  Feature requests?  I don't want to propagate
	this stuff, and I'm afraid that another public forum for them would
	only make the problem worse. There is some stuff submitted that would
	make for a very interesting page, and maybe someday we'll implement
	that.  But as it stands, the overhead and the potential for abuse is
	so high that we don't want to mess with it.

<A NAME="su500"></a>
<H2>How about giving us a reason for rejecting submissions?</H2> 

	<P>This is a fair request. As it stands, people merely see "Rejected"
	or "Accepted".  The <I>reasons</I> are simply left to their
	imagination. A simple reason like Offtopic, Boring, Badly Written,
	Repeat etc would go a long ways towards alleviating that problem.  But
	again, this is more work for our authors: right now we delete 3000
	submissions a week.  Each takes a half a second to click a button. 
	Even if this adds only 10 seconds of upkeep to each submission, that
	adds a full <I>day</I> of work each week! So, the answer is "someday".

	<P>Honestly, I don't think it's a very good idea for another reason too:
	the amount of email I got regarding story submissions more then doubled
	when we added the note telling people if their story was rejected. 
	When you have to say 'No' to 500 people a day, it's only logical that
	dozens of them will contest your decision.  I'm afraid that if they
	have more data, they'll email even more ("What do you mean my story was
	boring, you bastard!") and my wrists can't handle that ;)

<A NAME="su600"></a>
<H2>How about allowing readers to directly administer the submissions bin?</H2>

	<P>Slashdot is a very open community; in the user comments our readers
	are free to say whatever they please.  But we feel that the unique
	nature of Slashdot is largely because the contents of the homepage are
	determined by a handful of people.  

	<P>I'm sure a very cool website could be developed based on the concept
	of allowing public voting to determine the content of the homepage, but
	that website wouldn't be "Slashdot". If we tried to do it "by
	committee" it would suffer from the same problem that most projects
	done by committee suffer from: it would get bland.

	<P>Let me put this another way: in the comments, any pro-Linux or
	anti-MS comment is probably gonna get rated up.  Any time Microsoft
	does anything even slightly naughty, it gets submitted 50 times.  Does
	that mean that it should be posted to the Slashdot homepage?  For me
	personally, I don't want to read the "Bitch at Microsoft" website, but
	if ruled by popular consensus, Slashdot would very likely degenerate to
	this point.  Since the days of Chips & Dips and the first days of
	Slashdot, my first goal has always been to post stories that <I>I</I>
	thought were interesting. I think a lot of people share my idea of
	interesting, and that's part of why Slashdot became successful.  

	<P>Slashdot is an eclectic mix of stories maintained by a small group
	of people, but contributed to by anyone who wants to.  I think that the
	personality and character of Slashdot is part of the fun and charm of
	the site, and I think it would suck to lose it.  That's why the decision
	of what ends up on the homepage will continue to be determined by me,
	Hemos, and the rest of the guys.

<H2>How about an AvantGo channel or some other PDA interface</H2>

<P>
        There is one if you go to AvantGo, which basically uses the URL 
        <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/palm/">http://slashdot.org/palm/</A>.
	This is
        also the URL where the Slashdot clipping app gets its content, which 
        you used to be able to download from
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.slashdot.org/pub/slashdot.pqa">
        ftp://ftp.slashdot.org/pub/slashdot.pqa</a>
	but, sorry, that's not supported anymore.

<H2>How about a WAP Interface?</H2>

	<P>If you visit Slashdot at
	<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/slashdot.wml">http://slashdot.org/slashdot.wml</A>
	with a WAP compliant browser, you should get a stripped down view of Slashdot
	designed for WAP.  I wanted it to work on my 12x4 Qualcomm though, so it's
	pretty stripped down: no comments.   Just headlines and stories.

<H2>Getting the slashdot headlines by 'finger @www.slashdot.org' would be nice, don't you think?</H2>

<H2>Slashdot should cache pages to prevent the Slashdot Effect! </H2>

	<P>Sure, it's a great idea, but it has a lot of implications. For
	example, commercial sites rely on their banner ads to generate revenue.
	If I cache one of their pages, this will mess with their statistics,
	and mess with their banner ads. In other words, this will piss them
	off. 

	<P>Of course, most of the time, the commercial sites that actually have
	income from banner ads easily withstand the Slashdot Effect.  So
	perhaps we could draw the line at sites that don't have ads. They
	are, after all, much more likely to buckle under the pressure of all
	those unexpected hits. But what happens if I cache the site, and they
	update themselves? Once again, I'm transmitting data that I shouldn't
	be, only this time my cache is out of date!

	<P>I could try asking permission, but do you want to wait 6 hours for a
	cool breaking story while we wait for permission to link someone?  

	<P>So the quick answer is: "Sure, caching would be neat." It would make
	things a lot easier when servers go down, but it's a complicated issue
	that would need to be thought through in great detail before being
	implemented.

<A NAME="su910"></a>
<H2>Is it possible to have META tags that Slashdot looks for in a story link before 
  allowing it to be submitted/posted? Many times a server can't handle the load 
  of a Slashdotting. So can the site have tags to prevent it from being added 
  to a Slashdot story?</H2>

	<P>Not inconceivable, but I don't really think it's worth the work. 
	Most of the sites that are Slashdotted are prepared for it, and the
	sites that get smashed usually are caught completely off guard; they
	wouldn't know of this mysterious opt-out meta tag. (See also <A
	HREF="http://slashdot.org/faq/suggestions.shtml#su900">Caching Slashdot
	Stories</A>).

<A NAME="su920"></a>
<H2>It seems that many moderators, because of the way they read comments, 
(higher thresholds, older comments first), only see comments that are 
posted with a bonus, or have already been moderated up. Wouldn't it make
more sense to require moderators to read at a threshold of 0 with newest
comments first?</H2>

	<P>Yes, it would. This is something we're looking at, and may change. 
	(Another possibility might be randomizing the order of comments or 
	threads.) The  problem is that we don't want to make moderating too
	much of a pain for anyone. This would result in fewer people being
	willing to moderate, and moderators not doing their job.

<A NAME="su930"></a>
<H2>Have you ever thought about hiding comment scores when people are moderating? It might help alleviate "Group Think."</H2>

	<P>Yes, this is another thing we've considered. The problem here is that
	moderators are also supposed to keep one another in check. If a 
	moderator thinks something is rated too high, he or she can bring the 
	score down. So, the effect it might have on "group think" might actually
	be neutralized if moderators aren't able to counter each other.

<H2>I have a suggestion for improving moderation.</H2> 

	<P>Please read the <A HREF="com-mod.shtml">Comments & Moderation
	section</A> before emailing any of us with your suggestion.  The vast
	majority of suggestions I get are ideas that are already explained 
	there.  Of the remaining suggestions, most are ideas that I probably
	should put there.  The thing that is typically forgotten is that the
	moderation system is a complicated collection of checks and balances
	designed to prevent abuse: almost <I>every</I> suggestion that winds up
	in my inbox, however well intended, opens up a hole for abuse.

<A NAME="su1100"></a>
<H2>What about other moderation models such as those used by Kuro5hin,
everything2, or advogato.org?</H2>

	<P>While it's interesting to see what other sites are doing, these
	sites don't have anywhere near the traffic that Slashdot does. In
	order to  make it work on Slashdot's scale, any moderation system needs
	to be  efficient enough that we can apply it without grinding our
	servers to a  halt. The system we have now, while not perfect, is the
	best thing we've  seen for the scale we're working on. We're always
	looking for ways to improve it, and when we find  them we'll implement
	them, but for now we'll stick with what we've  got.

<H2>Will some of the subsections spin off as sites in their own right? </H2>

	
<P>For example, it would be cool if the YRO section were to hit dead tree form 
  in some way like soon. It's too important to remain outside the radars of 9-5ers 
  in Pleasantville. 
<P>There are no formal plans at this time, but it's something we're thinking seriously
