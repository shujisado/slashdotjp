<H1>Your user account has been banned from [% constants.sitename %]</H1><BR>
Your user account has been banned from [% constants.sitename %],
due to script flooding, or the posting of comments designed to break web browser
rendering, that originated from your network or IP address.  If you feel that
this is unwarranted, feel free to include your UID (<b>[% user.uid %]</b>) in the
subject of an email to
<A HREF="mailto:[% constants.adminmail_ban | strip_attribute %]">[% constants.adminmail_ban %]</A>,
and we will examine why there is a ban. If you fail to include the UID (again,
<em>in the subject!</em>), then your message will be deleted and ignored. I mean
come on, we're good, we're not psychic.
