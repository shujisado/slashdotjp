	# Here we find the possible sids that could have this tid and
	# then search only those.
	# ...but there are two ways to do this.  The proper way is to
	# do a "LEFT JOIN story_topics ON stories.sid=story_topics.sid" and
	# put a "story_topics.id IS NOT NULL" into the WHERE clause.  But
	# my guess is that on the searches by the larger topics, this will
	# be too slow.  The other way (which we have done so far) is to do
	# one select to pull out *all* sids with the topic(s) in question,
	# and then not join on story_topics, just use a "sid IN" clause.
	# The problem is that, for large topics, this may be very many sids;
	# on OSDN sites, we're seeing some topics with 4,000 to 13,000
	# stories in them.  That makes the SELECT too large to be efficient.
	# So I'm fixing this in a not very good way:  limiting the number
	# of stories we search, on any search that includes a topic
	# limitation.  This sucks and should be replaced with a real
	# solution ASAP -- this is only a stopgap! - Jamie 2003/11/10
	#
	# Changed sorting of story sids by time instead of sid.  This prevents
	# only dated stories from showing up when there were > 1000 
	# sids that were created prior to 2000 
	#
	# Added support for more correct left join method.  Also added vars
	# so you can choose to lose left join method or change the limit on
	# sids returned in the two select method
	#
	# Tweak to your site size and performance needs
