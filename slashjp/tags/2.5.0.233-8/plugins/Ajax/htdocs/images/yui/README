This directory holds a subset of the files from the YAHOO User Interface toolkit (YUI).
See <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/>.  We are currently using version 2.4.1.

The calendar.css file is the non-skin top level version from that release.  It is a super-set
of calendar-core.css.  That file is not needed.

Except for autocomplete.js, these files are straight from the release.  We have patched
autocomplete.js to also understand "POST".  Be sure to diff and re-apply if you update to
a later version of YUI.
