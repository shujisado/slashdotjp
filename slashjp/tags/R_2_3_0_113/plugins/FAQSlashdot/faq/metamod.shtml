<A NAME="mm100">
<H2>What do "M1" and "M2" mean?</H2>

	<P>M1 and M2 are Slashdot shorthand for "moderation" and 
	"metamoderation," respectively. We also use these with 
	suffixes For example, if you see the term "M2ed," it 
	means "metamoderated." Likewise, the term "M1er" means 
	"Moderator."

<A NAME="mm200">
<H2>What is metamoderation?</H2>

	<P>Metamoderation is a second layer of moderation. It seeks to 
	address the issue of unfair moderators by letting "metamoderators"
	(any logged-in Slashdotter) "rate the rating" of ten randomly selected
	comment posts. The metamoderator decides if the moderator's rating was
	fair, unfair, or neither.

<A NAME="mm300">
<H2>Why was metamoderation started?</H2>

	<P>Metamoderation began as an experiment to see if the primary
	moderation system (M1) was actually working. Now, it helps us to 
	remove bad moderators from the M1 eligibility pool and reward
	good moderators with more delicious mod points.

<A NAME="mm350">
<H2>Who can M2?</H2>

	<P>In order to be a metamoderator, your account has to be one of the 
	oldest 92.5% of accounts on the system. This means that once you've 
	created your account, you'll have to wait for several months,
	depending on the rate at which new accounts are being created.

<A NAME="mm400">
<H2>How can I metamoderate?</H2>

	<P>If you're eligible, and you're logged in, you can meta-moderate. You
	should see a link at the top of the main page that says "Have you Meta
	Moderated Recently?" Click that link, and you should be taken to the M2
	page.

<A NAME="mm500">
<H2>How often can I M2?</H2>

	<P>Several times per day (we adjust this slightly sometimes,
	to keep M1 and M2 in balance).

<A NAME="mm600">
<H2>How does M2 affect the moderator's karma?</H2>

	<P>This is a fairly complicated thing. Depending on some randomness, 
	the moderator's karma and a couple of other factors, a particular
	instance of meta-moderation may or may not change a moderator's karma
	score.
	
	<P>(We realize that's not much of an answer. If you're really, <I>
	really</I> interested, <A HREF="http://slashcode.com">read the

<A NAME="mm700">
<H2>How often do moderations appear for M2?</H2>

	<P>Five times when the system is humming smoothly, which it usually
	is. If we get more M1 or more M2 than normal, which happens rarely,
	we might temporarily go to three or seven.

<A NAME="mm800">
<H2>Why are there duplicate comments?</H2>

	<P>Remember, M2 rates the moderations, not the comments. If
	the same comment was moderated more than once, it may appear
	several times to a meta-moderator in order to rate the different
	moderations that have been applied to it.

<A NAME="mm900">
<H2>Why isn't there a link to M2 on my index.pl?</H2>

	<P>For starters, you have to be logged in, and you have to have
	spent some time on the site (months) to really get what it's all
	about, first --
	<a href="#mm350">see above</a>.
	Your karma must be Neutral or better. And if you unchecked the
	<A HREF="//slashdot.org/users.pl?op=edithome">Willing To
	Moderate</A>
	checkbox, we also assume you're not willing to M2.

<A NAME="mm1000"> <H2>How should I M2 if the moderator called it "Insightful"
and I think it should be "Informative"?</H2>
	
	<P>This comes under the general category of "don't sweat the small 
	stuff." "Interesting" and "Insightful" will have the same effect
	on the comment, and the difference between the two is basically just
	a judgment call. Rate the moderation "Fair," and move on.

<H2>Can I post to stories I'm M2ing?</H2>	

	<P>Yes.  <A HREF="com-mod.shtml#cm600">The posting restriction only

<A NAME="mm1200"><H2>Does M2 affect my karma?</H2>

	Maybe.  If you have relatively little karma, there is a possibility of 
	getting some karma for your efforts.  However you won't be able to get 
	enough karma to get <A HREF="com-mod.shtml#cm800">the +1 karma bonus</A>.
	That can only be earned by posting comments and getting moderated up. 
	This is to encourage people to M2, but not let them abuse it.
