Notes on installing the libraries and include files.  GD isn't the
easiest package to install because there are multiple build options,
and earlier versions used to have GIF support which was removed
because of patent issues so you have to be careful which version
you install.

Slash doesn't need GIF support, we output JPEGs (let's hope that
stays free of patent issues too).

If you want to install from source, go look for freetype, libpng,
jpeg-6b and gd on freshmeat.net :)

If you're on Debian, install these packages:

	libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev libttf2
	libjpeg62 libjpeg62-dev
	libgd2-xpm libgd2-xpm-dev libgd-tools

As of this writing (July 2003), only Debian testing and unstable have
the packages specifically named "libgd2-xpm" and "-dev".  On Debian
stable, they're called libgd2 and libgd2-dev but they're only version
2.0.1 -- the latest versions of GD.pm require 2.0.12, so that's a
problem, you'll probably have to install libgd from source.

Debian offers a prebuilt package of GD.pm, which you're welcome to
try;  as of now, they're libgd-gd2-perl and libgd-text-perl in Debian
testing and unstable.  Debian stable only has the GD perl modules for
GD 1.x.

We prefer to build the perl modules with the CPAN:

	install GD GD::Text GD::Text::Align

You may be asked about whether you want to build it with JPEG, FreeType and
XPM support;  answer yes, yes, and I don't think XPM matters either way.
If you have compile problems during the make, check which version of libgd
you have installed and compare against the library version that the perl
module's README says it requires.
