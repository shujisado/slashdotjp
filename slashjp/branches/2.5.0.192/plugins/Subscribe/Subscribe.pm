# Internal.
#
# There are three separate boolean subscriber-related decisions that
# must be made for each page delivered to someone who has paid for 1
# or more pages:
#
#         - Is this page ad-free?         adlessPage()
#         - Is this page bought?          buyingThisPage()
#         - Does this page get plums?     plummyPage()
#
# The decisions are separate.  But they are related, so the logic is
# all handled here in _subscribeDecisionPage.  Users get to control
# whether they want to see ads on three types of pages, plus implicit
# control over a fourth type of "all others" (which are adless but
# don't use up a subscription).  Users get to control the maximum
# number of pages per day that they will buy.  Beyond that point they
# start seeing ads on bought page types, but as long as their max is
# at least the default, those bought page types are still considered
# "plumworthy" or (and this is an ugly term but it's short) "plummy."
# And image hits are their own thing.
#
# So:
#
# adless = A && (B || C) && D      && !I
# buying = A &&  B       && D      && !I
# plummy = A && (B || C)      && E
#
# Where:
#
# [A] User is a subscriber, i.e.:
#         1. subscription plugin is installed and turned on
#         2. user is logged in
#         3. user has more paidfor pages than bought pages
# [B] User has stated they want this type of page bought
#         EXPLICITLY (it's one of the "big three" types and that
#         checkbox is checked for this user)
# [C] User wants this type of page bought IMPLICITLY (it's
#         not one of the "big three" but the user has at least
#         one of those checkboxes checked)
# [D] User has pages remaining for today before hitting the max
# [E] User's max pages per day to buy is set >= the default (10)
# [I] This hit is an image, not an actual page.

=head1 NAME

Slash::Subscribe - Let users buy adless pages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Slash::Subscribe;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin lets users purchase adless pages at /subscribe.pl, with
built-in (but optional) support for using Paypal.

Understanding its code will be easier after recognizing that one of its
design goals was to distinguish the act of "paying for" adless pages,
in which money (probably) trades hands, from the act of "buying," in
which adless pages are actually viewed.  After "paying for" a page, you
can still get your money back, but after you "bought" it, no refund.
