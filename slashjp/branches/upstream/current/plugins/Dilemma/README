This is a mathematical simulation/toy, of highly specialized purpose, and
thus not meant to be installed on most production websites.

It serves as sample code to demonstrate how to write a plugin with all
the major components:  SQL schema, SQL data, templates, slashd task,
frontend webpage script, and Makefile.PL and PLUGIN files of course.

For those interested in the Prisoner's Dilemma, who might want to use
this module on their Slash site or for information about programming
its strategies, please see README.Dilemma.
