why doesn't my browser respect the 8-char limit I asked for in the text box?

failure on users.pl ops switches to a new HC, because there is only one op
and generate_formkey is in its list of formkeyHandlers. There might be a
way for formkeyHandler to recognize that there is already an HC formkey
and to not generate a new one -- but that's an annoying amount of work.
