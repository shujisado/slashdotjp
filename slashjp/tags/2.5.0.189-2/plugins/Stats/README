For using stats.pl and getting pretty graphs, you need GD::Graph, which
relies on GD::Text::Align and GD.  If you have HumanConf working, then
all you need is GD::Graph (and if you have this working, HumanConf is
set up to work fine, with the one caveat that HumanConf uses JPEGs, and
GD::Graph uses PNG; JPEG support in GD is optional).

We use GD v1.  This is untested with v2.

How I did installed it on Debian:

* Using apt-get, installed libgd-dev and its dependencies.

* Using CPAN shell, installed GD 1.x.  The latest as of this writing is
  1.41, so at the cpan prompt typed "install L/LD/LDS/GD-1.41.tar.gz".

* Using CPAN shell, installed GD::Text::Align.  Several testing errors
  occur, but they don't seem to affect the module use for our purposes;
  use "force install GD::Text::Align" if necessary.

* Using CPAN shell, install GD::Graph.  Feel free to cd to "samples"
  in GD-Graph and type "make", and then look at the .png output
  files.  Your GD library may think you have GIF support when you don't;
  if so, edit save.pl to set "my $ext = 'png'" and type "make EXT=png".

On Red Hat:

* I fetched the sources jpegsrc.v6b, freetype-2.1.0, libpng-1.2.2,
  and gd-1.8.4.  I configured and installed them in that order.  I
  had to manually copy the headers for libpng and gd to /usr/local/include.
  It's all messy, but at some point you just don't care.

* I then did the same with the perl modules as above.


On Mac OS X (10.2, with fink):

* Using fink, installed gd, gd-shlibs, freetype1.

* I then did the same with the perl modules as above, except that I
  modified GD's Makefile.PL to look in "-I/sw/include" and "-L/sw/lib".
