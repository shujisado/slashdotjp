<H2>Can I advertise on Slashdot? </H2>

	
	<P>Yes! You too can have banner ads at the top of Slashdot. Impress
	your friends! Terrify your competitors!
	
	<P>Visit the <A HREF="/advertising.shtml">Advertising</A> page to learn 
	how.

<H2>What is AdFu?</H2> 

	<P><A HREF="http://www.adfu.com">AdFu</A> was written in mod_perl by <A
	HREF="http://www.blockstackers.com">BSI</A> to be a flexible system for
	serving banner ads for Slashdot and  <A
	HREF="http://www.everything2.com">Everything</A>. However, Slashdot
	isn't using it anymore (<A HREF="advertising.shtml#ad500">See below
	</A>). 
	
	<P>It's far from perfect, but you're welcome to download the code and
	try it out for yourself on your own website.

<A NAME="ad500">
<H2>Why aren't you using AdFu any more?</H2>

	<P>I liked AdFu, but Andover wanted to use a consistent system across
	their whole network, and they were more comfortable using their own
	system. Since it isn't my job to administer the ad server, I didn't
	care. AdFu continues to serve banner ads for several other sites, such
	as <A HREF="http://www.everything2.com">Everything2</A>.

<A NAME="ad600">
<H2>A banner ad is screwing up my browser!</H2>

	<P>Email <A HREF="mailto:hemos@slashdot.org">Hemos</A> and complain.  We
	have a pretty strict set of rules about what is allowed in a Slashdot
	banner ad, but occasionally an ad slips by unnoticed that breaks these
	rules. If you see a 50k banner or one that is launching Java or
	something, let us know and we'll take it down.  Our goal is to make our
	readers happy first and foremost.
