Don't forget to modify the display;article;default template to add a link to
the printable version of the story.  Lacking good taste and style, I use
something like this: 

<p>
[% printurl = 
	"<a href=\"$constants.rootdir/print.pl?sid=$story.sid\">print</a>";
   printurl;
%]
</p>

If you're interested in <link /> tag support, you can change header;misc;default
to add a link to the printable version.  Note that this must appear before the
</HEAD> line.  Pudge suggests:

	<link rel="alternate" href="[% constants.rootdir %]/print.pl?sid=[% sid %]"
		title="Printing Version" />

This assumes your version of article.pl passes 'sid' to the template.  As of
Slash 2.1.1 beta, it does not.

Note that there are two optional boolean parameters that can be passed to the
URL.

	- nohtml, if specified, will remove links from everything but the story
	- auto, if specified, will use JavaScript to attempt to pop up a print
	  dialog automatically

These should become user-configurable parameters.  Perhaps a future version of
print.pl will allow customization on this level.

Enjoy,
