<body>
Your software that crawls [% constants.sitename %]'s Palm pages is too
greedy and too fast. Be nice and tell your software to ease up on us.

<p>This ban will be lifted in 72 hours. Please don't email us before then.

<p>If you feel that this is unwarranted, feel free to include your IP address
(<b>[% ip %]</b>) in the
subject of an email to
<a href="mailto:[% constants.adminmail_ban | strip_attribute %]">[% constants.adminmail_ban %]</a>,
and we will examine why there is a ban. If you fail to include the IP
address (again, <em>in the subject!</em>), then your message will be
deleted and ignored. I mean come on, we're good, we're not psychic.
